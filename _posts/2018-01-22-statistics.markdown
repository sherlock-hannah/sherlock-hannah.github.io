Used to make decisions

- 1.range,variance,standand deviation,standand error
- 2.*DATA* *data analysis* "decriptive statistics"
skewness positive numbers means it's right skewed
negative numbers means it's left skewed
- Histogram: look at the tail.If one tail is longer than another, the distribution is skewed.
just need 1D data can contrive histogram because of y axis is becomes the count of data ,and bar chart need 2D data.
- 3.correlation
mention spurious relationship
- 4.p value
- 5.T-test ;two-sample t-test;paired t-test
- 6.analysis of variance(ANOVA)
- 7.regression
notice no values
standandlise regression coeffient


# mistakes:
- 1.right skewed
- 2.liner regression
