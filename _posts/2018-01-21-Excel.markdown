## Functions
- 1.TEXT(WEEKAND([DATE],"dddd"))   modify "date" format,
`DATA`+FENLIE
- 2.count sum, fliter,slicer
- 3.histogram

## Tips
- `ctrl + shift + down`
can select all on column datas  
`ctrl + shift + *` can select all table
- F3 key lets you paste name in formula
- `ctrl + 1` into format cells
-

## Use decriptive statistics
1. skewness-1<x<1`skew()`kurtosis`Kurt()`
2. mean`average()`,range,median`median()`,variance`var()`,standand deviation`stdev()`,mode`mode()`,standand error(most frequently occuring values)
3. 2nd highest value`large(values,2)`
2nd lowest value `small(values,2)`
rank `rank(cell,columnname,0 or 1)`
4. geometric mean `geomean()` is used to compute growth rate
CAGR(compound annual growth rate)
5. RULE OF THUMB:95% of your data is within 2 standand deviation of the mean, anything more than 2 std dev of mean is called outlier
`HOME - conditional formating - highlight cells rule - less than or more than`

## Boxplot
- box visually showing the range of the middle 50% of your data
- The line in the box is the median. The X in the box is the mean

## nominal data and ordinal data
- inserting pivot table to count the number of each category
- using `group` can divide data into some different scale

## Hierarchical Data
- Create a PivotTable and then change from Design tab the layout to Outline format and  then Paste Special Values the relevant data outside the PivotTable.
- Create sunburst and treemap charts to summarize this data.

## 80-20 rule and pareto charts

## problem
1. how to compute the rate of return for stock
2. tell the difference of nominal and ordinal,numerical and categorical.
If they do have a natural ordering, they are called ordinal categorical features. Otherwise if there is no intrinsic ordering, they are called nominal categorical features.(not numeral)
Nominal:
Car Models
Colors
TV Shows
Ordinal:
High-Medium-Low
1-10 Years Old, 11-20 Years Old, 30-40 Years Old
Happy, Neutral, Sad
3. Continuous features are usually numeric, and tend to exist within the subset of all real numbers.
