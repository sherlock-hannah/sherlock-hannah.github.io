## Functions
- 1.`TEXT(WEEKAND([DATE],"dddd"))`   modify "date" format,
`DATA`+FENLIE
- 2.`FORMULATEXT` display formula of specify cells
- 3.`CONCATENATE(B3,C3)` merge text of cells

## Tips
- `ctrl + shift + down`
can select all on column datas  
`ctrl + shift + *` can select all table
- F3 key lets you paste name in formula
- `ctrl + 1` into format cells
- `$`before cell can fix a cell

## Use decriptive statistics
1. skewness-1<x<1`skew()`,kurtosis`Kurt()`
2. mean`average()`,range,median`median()`,variance`var()`,
standand deviation`stdev()`,mode`mode()`,standand error(most frequently occuring values)
3. 2nd highest value`large(values,2)`
2nd lowest value `small(values,2)`
rank `rank(cell,columnname,0 or 1)`
4. geometric mean `geomean()` is used to compute growth rate
CAGR(compound annual growth rate)
5. RULE OF THUMB:95% of your data is within 2 standand deviation of the mean, anything more than 2 std dev of mean is called outlier
`HOME - conditional formating - highlight cells rule - less than or more than`

## Boxplot
- box visually showing the range of the middle 50% of your data
- The line in the box is the median. The X in the box is the mean

## Nominal data and ordinal data
- inserting pivot table to count the number of each category
- using `group` can divide data into some different scale

## Hierarchical Data
- Create a PivotTable and then change from Design tab the layout to Outline format and  then Paste Special Values the relevant data outside the PivotTable.
- Create sunburst and treemap charts to summarize this data.

## pivot table
- drug the columnname into row and into value ,will count the number of different attributes in this columnname.

## 80-20 rule and pareto charts
the 20% will generate 80%

## Finding the Mean of a Discrete Random Variable
- `=SUMPRODUCT(:,:)` return the result of different array times each other
- Standard deviation `=SQRT(Variance)`

### Binomial Random Variable
`BINOM.DIST.RANGE(n,p,s1,s2)`
Probability of between s1 and s2,successes (inclusive)
### Possion Random Variable

`POISSON.DIST(x,mean,0)`gives probability of exactly x events,

`POISSON.DIST(x,mean,1) `gives probability of <=x events.x inclusive.

### Normal Random Variable

mean µ,standard deviation sigma σ

`NORM.DIST(x,µ,σ,True)`gives probability that a normal random variable with given mean and sigma is <=x or <x.
Change True to False you get height of normal density at x.

standand normal `NORM.S.DIST(x)` `NORM.S.INV(x)`

`NORM.INV(p,µ,σ)`gives value v  of a normal random variable with given mean and sigma such that Prob(Normal RV<=v) = p

- Excel `STANDARDIZE` function can be used to compute Z scores

## Confidence Interval for Population Mean
Lower Limit:xbar-1.96*sigma/sqrt(n)
Upper Limit:xbar+1.96*sigma/sqrt(n)
`NORM.S.INV(0.975) `= 1.96

## Blyth Confidence Interval
 1-alpha^(1/n)
 n = times
 alpha = 0.05

## Sample Size
 n = (1.96σ/E)^2

E :accurate numbers
## Problem
1. how to compute the rate of return for stock
2. tell the difference of nominal and ordinal,numerical and categorical.
If they do have a natural ordering, they are called ordinal categorical features. Otherwise if there is no intrinsic ordering, they are called nominal categorical features.(not numeral)
Nominal:
Car Models
Colors
TV Shows
Ordinal:
High-Medium-Low
1-10 Years Old, 11-20 Years Old, 30-40 Years Old
Happy, Neutral, Sad
3. Continuous features are usually numeric, and tend to exist within the subset of all real numbers.
