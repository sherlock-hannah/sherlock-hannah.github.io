## model_selection
1. linear regression

## problems
1.when I use linux ,it couldn't show my drawings.so at first I should put `%matlotlib inline`
2.deprecation warning when using sklearn 0.19 , the solution is using `from sklearn.model_selection import KFold` instead of `from sklearn.cross_validation import KFold`
