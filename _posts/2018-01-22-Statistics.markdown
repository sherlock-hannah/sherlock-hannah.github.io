Used to make decisions
## decriptive statistics
- 1.range,variance,standand deviation, standand error
- 2.skewness positive numbers means it's right skewed.
    negative numbers means it's left skewed
- 3. Histogram: look at the tail. If one tail is longer than another, the distribution is skewed. just need 1D data can contrive histogram because of y axis is becomes the count of data ,and bar chart need 2D data.
- 4.correlation
 Correlation values may range from -1 to 1, where 1 would mean the two features are perfectly positively correlated and have identical slopes for all values. -1 would mean they are perfectly negatively correlated, and have a negative slope for one another, again being linear.
mention spurious relationship
- 4.p value
- 5.T-test ;two-sample t-test;paired t-test
- 6.analysis of variance(ANOVA)
- 7.regression standandlise regression coeffient

## basic Probability
- independent event : Two events A and B are independent if and only if Prob(A and B) = Prob(A) * Prob(B)
- mutually exclusive:A and B are mutually exclusive,We know Prob(A and B) = 0. For independence, we then need Prob(A)* Prob(B) = 0.
- Conditional Probability:P(A|B)=P(A ∩ B) / P(B)
- Law of Total Probability(find a chance of event by adding up all rhe mutually exclusive ways event can happen):P(A) = ∑ P(A|Bi) * P(Bi)

## hypothesis testing
1. state hypothesis
H0 =null hypothesis H1= alternative hypothesis
2. analysis plan
T-test
3. gather data
4. analyze
mean score ,T score
5. interpret
if the statistics Probability is less than the significance level ,the null hypothesis is rejected











## problems:
- 1.right skewed
- 2.liner regression
