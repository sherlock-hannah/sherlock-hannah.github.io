## Execute sequence

(1)from
(3) join
(2) on
(4) where
(5)group by(use alias)
(6) avg,sum....
(7)having
(8) select
(9) distinct
(10) order by

## Tips

- structure query language, GUI Tools:Navicat
- RDBMS: Relational Database Management System.ER:entity relationship
- Windows power shell:
 `mysql -uroot -p`
 `show databases;`
- create sql user:
 `grant all on databases_name.* to "username"@"localhost" identified by "password"`
- show the structure of tables:`desc tablename;`
- `'string' as column_name`can use this string instead column

## Loading data

### MySQL

```
load data local infile "C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 5.1/Data/Kaggle/test.csv"
into table test
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES
(PassengerId,Pclass,Name,Sex,Age,SibSp,Parch,Ticket,Fare,Cabin,Embarked;)
SET expired_date = STR_TO_DATE(@expired_date, '%m/%d/%Y');

```

### SQL Server

```
BULK INSERT RBP.dbo.user_log
FROM 'D:\Repeat Buyers Prediction\data_format1\user_log_format1.csv'
WITH(
	FIELDTERMINATOR = ',',
	ROWTERMINATOR = '0x0a',
	 firstrow = 2);
```
- .bak is backup database [import](http://www.cnblogs.com/OnlyYou/archive/2011/11/28/2265731.html)
- .mdf .ldf
- .sql `source xxx.sql`import outside sql files

## Export

```
select
from test
into outfile "c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/Repeat Buyers Prediction/feature/expandedtest.csv"
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
```

## PRIMARY KEY

Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.

A table can have only one primary key, which may consist of single or multiple fields

-  if a column set primary key,there are not duplicated value `Alter table tableNAME drop primary key`
- To create a PRIMARY KEY constraint on the "ID" column `ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD PRIMARY KEY (ID);`

## index

`create INDEX index_name on table_name(column_name)`

## DDL(data defination language)

### CREATE DATABASE
 `CREATE DATABASE <DATABASE Name>`

### DELETE DATABASE
`DROP DATABASE databasename;
`
### DELETE TABLE

- `DROP TABLE <tableNAME>;`

- `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`


eg:

```
DELETE FROM USER_action
WHERE a_date
BETWEEN '2017-06-01 00:00:00' AND '2017-06-20 00:00:00'
```
- delete all data in table ,but save the table Structures `TRUNCATE TABLE table1`



### UPDATE TABLE
- statement is used to modify the existing records in a table
 `update table_name set column_name="value" where condition`

- `ALTER  <Tablename> ADD (<column name1>,<name2>,.....);`

- `UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;`

- how to change column data_type

`ALTER table TABLEname
CHANGE column_name column_name datatype`

### DROP COLUMN

`ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;`


### CREATE TABLE
 `create table tablename(columnname1 type primary key,columnname2 type,columnname3 type ) ;`

 eg:

 ```
Create table test(PassengerId      int(64) primary key,
Pclass           int(64),
Name            varchar,
Sex             varchar,
Age            float,
SibSp            int,
Parch            int,
Ticket          int,
Fare           float,
Cabin           varchar,
Embarked        varchar);
```

- rename `RENAME TABLE newname to oldname;`

## DML(data Manipulation language)

### SELECT(define which columns to return)

- `SELECT <Column name>,..,...
FROM <TABLEname>;`

- query all columns: use `*` to replace ` <column name>`

- using alias to creat a new column
`select column_name1,column_name2 as alias from table_name`

- removing duplicates
`SELECT distinct `

 - notice if you `SELECT distinct columnname1,column2`,
it will delete row when both columnname1 and column2 are repetated


### WHERE(search condition,filters rows using a predicate)

- `WHERE search condition'`
- `WHERE like "k%"`
  - to match any string of zero or more characters, use %
  - to match characters that are not R, use [^R]
  - to match a numeral, use [0-9]

### GROUP BY

- `GROUP BY column_name`group by list,arrange rows by group

Grouping Operators

- `GROUP BY year ASC WITH ROLLUP;`

ROLLUP the query produces an extra super-aggregate summary row

- `GROUPING()`
return 1 when  super-aggregate summary row

- `CUBE`

- `GROUPING SET`


### HAVING(search condition,filters group using a predicate)

- specified group condition,filter the groups

- `HAVING search condition`

 - can't use `WHERE` because it run before `sum`and `group by`

### ORDER BY

- `ORDER BY column_name asc`
 - upward `asc`
 - downward `desc`


- limit
`limit m,n`  m stands for starting from m-1 rows,n means n rows
sort before limit

`limit x offset y ` from Y rows next X rows


### INSERT
can omit identity columns,columns that allow null,and columns with default constraints.

- insert value

`insert into table_name (column_name) value()`

- insert ... select/insert ... EXEC

insert results return by the query or stored procedure into existing table

`insert into table_name (column_name)
select column_name from table_name;`

- select ... into
create a new table from the result of query
`select * into custcopy from Customers`

aliyun odps

```
DROP TABLE if EXISTS train_copy;
CREATE TABLE train_copy like odps_tc_257100_f673506e024.forecast_program_round1_train;
insert OVERWRITE TABLE train_copy
SELECT * from odps_tc_257100_f673506e024.forecast_program_round1_train;
```

- `STR(number, length, decimal_places)` return a string representation of a number



### Logical Functions
SQL Server(MSSQL)

- `ISNUMERIC(expression)` if the expression is number ,then return 1 else 0.
- `IIF(ProductCategoryID IN (5,6,7), 'Bike', 'Other')`
'bike' is the true place ,'other' is the false place .

MySQL

- `IFNULL(expression,NULL) `
if expression cannot find ,then return null.




### Scala function


#### Date Functions

[MySQl time function conclusion](http://www.cnblogs.com/she27/articles/1377089.html)

- `datediff(interval,date1,date2)` Return the difference in days between two date values:

- `getdate()`return the current date

eg:

```
datediff(yy,salestartdate,getdate())
```

- `timediff(time1,time2)`the subtraction of two date

- `year()`
- `day()`
- `datename(mm,column_name),datename(dw,column_name)`
- mysql: `week()`,`weekday()`
sql-server :`DATEPART(week,time)`, `DATEPART(weekday,time)`

eg:

```
SELECT DATENAME(year,o_date) as year,
DATENAME(month,o_date) as month,
count(distinct [user_id]) as numofuser,
count([user_id]) as numoforder
FROM [jingdong].[dbo].[USER_order]
GROUP BY DATENAME(year,o_date),DATENAME(month,o_date)
ORDER BY CONVERT(INT,DATENAME(month,o_date)
```





#### String Functions

- `CONCAT(string1, string2, ...., string_n)`Concatenate string together
- `LEFT(string, number_of_chars)`Extract a substring from a string (starting from left):

- sql_server:`SUBSTRING(string, start, length)`extracts a substring from a string (starting at any position).
mysql:`SUBSTR(string, start, length)`
- `CHARINDEX(substring, string, start_pos)` returns the location of a substring in a string.
- `REVERSE(string)`  reverses a string and returns the result
- `SELECT length(column_name) from table_name`Returns the length of the specified string (in bytes)
`len()` (sql Server)
- `STR(number, length, decimal_places)` return a string representation of a number
- `SELECT COALESCE(NULL, NULL, NULL, 'W3Schools.com', 'Example.com');`
return the first non-null expression in a list









### Window function(online analytical processing)

#### rank

- `rank()`
the same numeric value for ties (for example 1, 2, 2, 4, 5)

- `danse rank()`

 Returns the rank of rows within the partition of a result set, without any gaps in the ranking.

- `row_number()`
numbers all rows sequentially (for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).


EG:

```
select column_name,column_name1,
    rank() over (partition by columnname1 order by
                    column_name2) as columnname3

from tableNAME

```                    
`partition by `set the object scale of ranking

(just use in select sentence)

#### Aggregate functions as window function

- moving sum

```
sum(columnname1) over (order by column_name2)
as columnname3
```
- moving average

`avg(columnname) over (pattern by column_name order by columnname1 rows 2 preceding)  as new_column `

`preceding` means n rows before current row,`following`means n rows after current row.

###  Random data

- rand() generate fixed scale random data

- `RAND()*(max-min)+min `

- `ROUND(CAST(RAND()*(9.5-0.5)+0.5 as double),2)`



## Grouping Sets and Pivoting Data

### Grouping Sets

GROUPING SETS subclause builds on GROUP BY clause
```
SELECT <column list with aggregate(s)>
FROM <source>
GROUP BY
GROUPING SETS
(
	<column_name>,--one or more columns
	<column_name>,--one or more columns
	() -- empty parentheses if aggregating all rows
);
```

1. group by (column_name1)
2. group by (column_name2)


### ROLLUP and CUBE

ROLLUP provides shortcut for defining grouping sets with combinations that assume input columns form a hierarchy
```
SELECT StateProvince, City, COUNT(CustomerID) AS Customers
FROM Sales.vCustomerDetails
GROUP BY ROLLUP(StateProvince, City)
ORDER BY StateProvince, City;
```
1. group by()
2. group by (StateProvince)
3. group by (StateProvince, City)

CUBE provides shortcut for defining grouping sets in which all possible combinations of grouping sets created
```
SELECT SalesPersonName, CustomerName, SUM(Amount) AS TotalAmount
FROM Sales.vSalesOrders
GROUP BY CUBE(SalesPersonName, CustomerName)
ORDER BY SalesPersonName, CustomerName;
```
1. group by()
2. group by (StateProvince)
3. group by (city)
3. group by (StateProvince, City)


### Identifying Groupings in Results

`GROUPING()`
return 1 when  super-aggregate summary row

## Pivoting Data

Pivoting data is rotating data from a rows-based orientation to a columns-based orientation
```
SELECT OrderID, Bikes, Accessories, Clothing
FROM
(SELECT OrderID, Category, Revenue FROM Sales.SalesDetails) AS sales
PIVOT (SUM(Revenue) FOR Category IN([Bikes], [Accessories], [Clothing])) AS pvt
```

### Using PIVOT and UNPIVOT

UNPIVOT ()





## Case when

```
CASE WHEN <expression> THEN
     WHEN <expression> THEN
     ELSE<>
END
```

eg:

```
SELECT sample_id, x, y,
	case when label_value = 0 then 1
	when label_value > 0 and label_value <=  9.9 then 2
	when label_value > 9.9 and label_value <= 24.9 then 3
	when label_value > 24.9 and label_value <= 49.9 then 4
	ELSE 5 END
	as label_value
FROM ${t1};
```

## Null

The result of any expression containing a NULL value is NULL
`2 + NULL = NULL`

- null functions: `IFNULL()`function lets you return an alternative value if an expression is NULL:

sql Server
- `ISNULL(expression, alt_value)`

The ISNULL() function returns the alt_value, if the expression is a NULL;
The ISNULL() function returns the expression, if the expression is NOT NULL

## Operators

- `=`
` < >`
 is exclusive of the range of value specified

- in a specified value matches any value in a subquery or a list
- AND
`SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;`
- OR
`SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;`
- NOT
`SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;`



## The predicates

### like

= `WHERE column_name like  '%ddd%'`
- `WHERE column_name like 'ddd_' `

### between

- `SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;`

is inclusive of the range of the value specified


### is NULL(extract some value is null)

- `WHERE column_name is NULL`

- is not NULL(extract some value is not null)
`WHERE column_name is not NULL`

### in (simple use of or )

`WHERE column_name (not) in (2,3,5) `

### EXISTS

- `select *
from user_info as I
where exists
(select * from train as T
	where I.user_id = T.user_id)`



-   `not exist`


## Joins

combine rows from multiple tables by specifying matching criteria,usually
based on primary key -foreign key relationship

![sqljoin](/pictures/sqljoin.JPG)

### inner joins

```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```
Inner joins return only rows where a match can be found in both tables.

### outer JOINS(designated with left,right,full keyword)

- Use a Left Outer Join to include all rows from the first table and values from matched rows in the second table.

- Columns in the second table for which no matching rows exist are populated with NULLs.

```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

#### full

```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

### cross JOINS

combine each row from first table with each row from second table
![crossjoin](/pictures/crossjoin.png)

```
select column_name1,column_name2
FROM table1 as t1
CROSS JOIN table2 as t2
```

### self JOINS

```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;
```

## Union

### UNION(returns a result set of distinct rows)

```
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION (ALL)
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
```

UNION ALL retains duplicates during query processing

- intersect(returns only distinct rows that appear in both result set )


- except  (returns only distinct rows that appear in the first set but not the second)



## Table Expressions

### Views

a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
- CREATE VIEW Examples

```
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW [view_name] AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
example
```
CREATE VIEW [Products Above Average Price] AS
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice
FROM Products
WHERE UnitPrice > (SELECT AVG(UnitPrice) FROM Products);
```
- query the view
`select * from [view_name]`
- DROP VIEW`DROP VIEW view_name;`
-  cannot use `order by`
-  if you want to `update` `insert` `delete` , the view should satisfy those requirement
1. not use `distinct` `having` `group by`
2. just one table

### Temporary Tables

Temporary tables are used to hold temporary result sets within a user’s session
```
CREATE TABLE #tmpProducts
(ProductID INTEGER,
 ProductName varchar(50));
GO
…
SELECT * FROM #tmpProducts;
```

### Table Variables

```
DECLARE @varProducts table
(ProductID INTEGER,
 ProductName varchar(50));
…
SELECT * FROM @varProducts
```
Use only on very small datasets

### Table-Valued Functions

```
CREATE FUNCTION Sales.fn_GetOrderItems (@OrderID AS Integer)
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
(SELECT ProductID, UnitPrice, Quantity
FROM Sales.OrderDetails
WHERE OrderID = @OrderID);
…
SELECT * FROM Sales.fn_GetOrderItems (1025) AS LineItems;
```
TVFs are named objects with definitions stored in a database
Table-Valued Functions (TVFs) are functions that return a rowset.

### Derived Tables

Derived table are named query expression created within an outer select query.
```
SELECT orderyear, COUNT(DISTINCT custid) AS cust_count
FROM
	(SELECT YEAR(orderdate) AS orderyear, custid
	FROM Sales.Orders) AS derived_year
GROUP BY orderyear;
```

### Common Table Expressions

```
WITH OrgReport (ManagerID, EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Level)
AS
(
	SELECT e.ManagerID, e.EmployeeID, EmployeeName, 0
	FROM HR.Employee AS e
	WHERE ManagerID IS NULL
	UNION ALL
	SELECT e.ManagerID, e.EmployeeID, e.EmployeeName, Level + 1
	FROM HR.Employee AS e
	INNER JOIN OrgReport AS o ON e.ManagerID = o.EmployeeID
)
SELECT * FROM OrgReport
OPTION (MAXRECURSION 3);
```









## Subqueries

Results of inner query passed to outer query


### Scalar subquery

returns single value to outer query

### Multi-valued subquery

Used with IN predicate

### self-contained

have no connection with the outer query other than passing it results

### Correlated

- Dependent on outer query, cannot be executed separately
- Behaves as if inner query is executed once per outer row

```
SELECT orderid, empid, orderdate
FROM Sales.Orders AS O1
WHERE orderdate = (SELECT MAX(orderdate)
	                          FROM Sales.Orders AS O2
	                          WHERE O2.empid = O1.empid)
ORDER BY empid, orderdate;
```



## Apply

- cross apply conceptually similar to cross join
- outer apply conceptually similar to left join
```
SELECT S.supplierid, s.companyname, P.productid, 	P.productname, P.unitprice
FROM Production.Suppliers AS S
CROSS APPLY dbo.fn_TopProductsByShipper(S.supplierid) AS P
```
